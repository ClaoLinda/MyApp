# Myapp
# Fisrt of all I want to thank you for the oportunity to work on this challenge.
# Here is what I did to learn the tools outline by the requirements:
# I started by learning more about node.js and Javascript. I found what I learned facinating and exciting so I took more time than I coud afford just learning
# Then I moved on to learn about Nuxt.js and Vue which were harder for me to grasp.


# A few things about the Challenge:
# It was exciting, but overwellming. I hope it is appropiate for me to write what I am about to write, but if not I apologize in advance.
# I beleive I mention in the application that I have an emotional disability (If I did not I apologize). That being said I beleive it would be good to have a customize version of this challenge for people who suffer from anxiety and things like that. Something that may help is to divide the challenge into pieces and have the applicant go about it in small increments. it could also help to simplyfy the challenge and make it more focus giving only 2 or 3 new things to learn. 
# I hope this helps in any way. I am not sure what are the measurements by which the results of this challenge will qualified in the sense of an evaluationg, but I want you to know that I am definetly grateful for the oportunity because challenges like this make you thoughter.
